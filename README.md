# EcoSage

*Theme:* Sustainability | AI-powered Waste Management

---

## *Project Description*
EcoSage is an AI-driven platform designed to help users classify waste, track their carbon footprint, and participate in gamified eco-challenges. The system uses image recognition to guide proper waste segregation and provides actionable insights to reduce environmental impact.

---

## *Features*
- *Image Recognition for Waste Sorting*: Uses AI/CNN models to classify waste into categories like biodegradable, recyclable, or hazardous.  
- *Personalized Carbon Footprint Calculator*: Tracks environmental impact based on user activities and habits.  
- *Gamified Eco-Challenges*: Engage users with challenges, earn points, and compete on leaderboards.  
- *Community Event Scheduling*: Users can discover and participate in local sustainability events.  
- *Push Notifications*: Alerts for waste collection schedules, eco-tips, and challenge updates.
